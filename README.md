# Hi, I'm nekoama

I am a high school student with loads of free time on my hands. During my free time, I like to watch anime, read manga, play some video games, or design some cool websites. I am an anime and manga enthusiast with 156 anime watched and 146 manga read. I have consumed quite a bit of anime and manga if I do say so myself. Some of my favorite titles include **Steins;Gate, Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Come wa Machigatteiru, Hyouka** and **ReLife**.
